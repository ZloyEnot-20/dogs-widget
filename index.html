            Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of dogs
            are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other
            dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the alpha
            male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs
            often view their owner as the alpha male.
